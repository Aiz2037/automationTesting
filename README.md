This project demonstrates my skill in using Java, Selenium Webdriver and TestNG framework to automate web application testing.

In this project, I have developed automated test scripts with key focus on testing the functionalities of OrangeHRM application.

In addition, I have created test cases to be automated which also encompass both positive and negative scenarios, to ensure the testing has wider coverage. 

OrangeHRM Inc. is a HR software company based in Secaucus, New Jersey, best known for its Human resource management system.
